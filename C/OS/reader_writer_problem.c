// Suppose we have a shared memory area (critical section). It is possible to protect the shared data behind a mutual exclusion mutex,
// in which case no two threads can access the data at the same time. However, this solution is sub-optimal, because it is possible that a reader R1 might have the lock,
// and then another reader R2 requests access. It would be foolish for R2 to wait until R1 was done before starting its own read operation; instead, R2 should be allowed to
// read the resource alongside R1 because reads don't modify data, so concurrent reads are safe. This is the motivation for the first readers-writers problem, in which the
// constraint is added that no reader shall be kept waiting if the share is currently opened for reading.
//
//
// The first solution is suboptimal, because it is possible that a reader R1 might have the lock, a writer W be waiting for the lock, and then a reader R2 requests access.
// It would be unfair for R2 to jump in immediately, ahead of W; if that happened often enough, W would starve. Instead, W should start as soon as possible. This is the
// motivation for the second readers-writers problem, in which the constraint is added that no writer, once added to the queue, shall be kept waiting longer than absolutely
// necessary.
//
// In fact, the solutions implied by both problem statements can result in starvation â€” the first one may starve writers in the queue, and the second one may starve
// readers. Therefore, the third readers-writers problem is sometimes proposed, which adds the constraint that no thread shall be allowed to starve; that is, the operation
// of obtaining a lock on the shared data will always terminate in a bounded amount of time.
